        Hi. My name is Jan-Kayleigh. But I prefer to just be called, "Kayleigh." I started life just like everyone else, with a pained smile and a look of determination that said: "Yes, I can!"" But at the end of the day, I'm only a child of God.

      <p>
        Every little girl had their dreams of becoming a ballerina or the next big fashion designer. But I had bigger dreams of becoming a professional knife thrower. Unfortunately, knife-throwers don't offer anything long-term; so at the bitter age of 13, in applying my mother's expensive red lipsticks on the sunsets in my paintings, I found a creative passion for art in any form I possibly could get my hands on. From the piano to painting, then on to just sketching and fashion design. Eventually, I started a lifestyle fashion blog in 2012 where I found I was more interested in designing my website instead of the content. I ended up ditching my blog, and designed random websites for my friends over the years and created constructive ideas with just my computer and a few hours of commitment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Taking my newfound love for computers and design to the next level, I decided to pursue New York Code and Design Academy after realizing that I wanted to learn the real thing in Web Development. Today, I feel grateful to be able to attend and learn more about the technology industry with my little dog, Toby Houndstooth.
