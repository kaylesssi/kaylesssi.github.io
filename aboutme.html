          Kayleigh hails from the Hudson Valley in the state of New York as a current college student. After graduating high school and spending two years at a local community college, she decided to explore other options aside from her major in Business Administration. She enrolled into The New York Code and Design Academy to pursue a certificate in Web Development and Front-End Web Development. Using her new novice skills in coding and having a understanding in design, she decided to create her own website to challenge her own skills. She currently lives in New York with her pupper, Toby Houndstooth.
